- **3D Text Overlays**: Player names appear as floating 3D text in world space  
- **Spatial Tracking**: Text labels stay positioned relative to players as you move
- **World-Scale AR**: Text appears at proper depth and distance in the real world
- **Motion Tracking**: Labels persist and track smoothly as the camera moves
- **60fps Performance**: Optimized for real-time AR at full frame rate

## Core Features

- **Jersey Number Recognition**: Uses ML Kit for real-time text detection
- **Player Database**: Instant lookup of player information with Room database
- **3D AR Text Bubbles**: Custom AR overlays with player names
- **Team Management**: Tap-to-learn team colors and collaborative editing

## How It Works (Real-Time AR)

1. **ARCore Session**: Initializes world-tracking session with high-quality camera feed
2. **Frame Analysis**: CameraX captures frames, ML Kit processes for text detection
3. **Number Recognition**: ML Kit OCR identifies jersey numbers from detected text regions
4. **Database Lookup**: Numbers are instantly matched against Room database
5. **AR Overlay Rendering**: Custom View renders floating text bubbles in camera space
6. **Real-time Tracking**: Bubbles follow detected players using bounding box coordinates

## Usage

### Basic AR Camera

### Adding Players

Use the Admin panel or modify the sample data in `PlayerViewModel.kt`:

```kotlin
Player(
    number = 42,
    name = "Your Player",
    position = "Position",
    team = "Team Name",
    academicYear = "Senior"
)
```

### Improving Detection

- **Better Lighting**: Ensure good lighting conditions for optimal text detection
- **Camera Distance**: Maintain appropriate distance from players (2-10 meters)
- **Jersey Contrast**: High contrast jerseys work better for number detection
- **Stable Positioning**: Keep camera steady for better tracking

- [ ] **Video Recording**: Record AR sessions with overlays
- [ ] **Statistics**: Player appearance tracking and analytics
- [ ] **Offline Maps**: ARCore Cloud Anchors for persistent placement

## Troubleshooting

### ARCore Issues
- Ensure device supports ARCore (check [ARCore supported devices](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices))
- Update Google Play Services for AR
- Restart app if AR tracking fails

### Camera Not Working
- Grant camera permissions in Android Settings > Apps > PlayerID > Permissions
- Ensure camera is not being used by another app
- Restart device if camera preview appears black

### No Player Names Appearing
- Verify players exist in the database
- Ensure jersey numbers are clearly visible and well-lit
- Check that numbers are not obscured or at extreme angles
- Try different camera distances (2-10 meters optimal)

### App Performance Issues
- Close other apps to free up memory
- Ensure device meets minimum requirements (Android 7.0+, 4GB RAM)
- Lower camera quality in settings if performance is poor
